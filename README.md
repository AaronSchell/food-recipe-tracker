# food-recipe-tracker
This is a custom console application written in C# that makes cooking and shopping that much easier.  The application can be updated with all of your favorite recipes.  You can then use the application to keep track of all your current ingredients you have in your kitchen.  Finally the application can list all of the food (from your recipes) you can make with your current ingredients to help with meal planning. This can also help with shopping for minimal ingredients to complete meals (that you may be missing one or two ingredients for). 

-Project start date: 1/13/2018

Possible features after launch:

1. Track ingredient expiration dates and suggest using recipes based on ingredients "on their last leg".
2. Change from console application to web application with accounts and online access to see ingredients from your phone.
3. Create moblie application to take it on the go (aka when buying groceries).
