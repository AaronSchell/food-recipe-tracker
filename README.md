# food-recipe-tracker
This is a custom console application written in C# that makes cooking and shopping that much easier.  The application can be updated with all of your favorite recipes.  You can then use the application to keep track of all your current ingredients you have in your kitchen.  Finally the application can list all of the food (from your recipes) you can make with your current ingredients to help with meal planning. This can also help with shopping for minimal ingredients to complete meals (that you may be missing one or two ingredients for).
